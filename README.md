# Twitter 'Likes' Hider

Are you on Twitter, but need to ensure that no wrongthink invades your echo chamber? Want to seal your filter bubble even tighter? Got all the idiots blocked, the dummies muted, and problematic retweets banned from your feed?

There is yet one more crack in your Twitter dam: sometimes, annoyingly, Twitter will show you what other people in your newsfeed 'like'. Who cares?  You do! There you are, deep in harmonious clicktrance, seeing only ideas that make you happy, and then suddenly, Twitter shows you the 'like' of some misguided follower, and now your harmony is ruined as you spend the next several hours arguing with strangers on the internet. There is no way to block this either!

Until now.

**Twitter 'Likes' Hider** prevents that unhappy occurrence. Install it and be bothered no more with the likes and preferences of stupid, crazy and bad people!  

Note that **Twitter 'Likes' Hider** works only on your main Twitter feed. If you visit a profile and see something horrible that they like, well, you have only yourself to blame, don't you.
